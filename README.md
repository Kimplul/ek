# Ek

Ek (oak in Swedish) is my toy programming language.
Currently far from a usable state, but I thought I might
still put it up on GitHub. Get them green squares, yo.

# Building

+ `make`

Add `RELEASE=1` to enable optimizations.

# Ek features and target use case

Ek is inteded to be a simple language, similar to C with little to no runtime but with
some quality of life improvements, mainly stuff already seen in other languages.
Nothing particularly ground-breaking. It currently targets my `tri`
architecture, and acts as a frontend for the `qbt` middle-end.

# Tests

Tests are currently broken, I'm going to have to come up with some half decent
testing framework.

# Name

Ek is the current name, mainly because I like oaks and didn't seem to step on anyone's toes.
I had a number of names I toyed around with before pushing to GitHub, any mentions of other
names should be disregarded and preferrably fixed.
